# Classification-of-Imbalance-Dataset
Binary Classification for Imbalance Dataset,  pre-processing and EDA, ML methods and NN.

There are three notebook, first one is * [pre-processing and EDA] (https://github.com/parinazfa/Classification-of-Imbalance-Dataset/blob/main/Pre-processing%20data_final.ipynb), second one is [Machine Learning methods with Under and Upper sampling] (https://github.com/parinazfa/Classification-of-Imbalance-Dataset/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Methods.ipynb), finally, [the NN notebook] (https://github.com/parinazfa/Classification-of-Imbalance-Dataset/blob/main/DeepNeuralNet.ipynb).
